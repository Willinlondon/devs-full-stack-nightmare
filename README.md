A Makers project for week 11-12, Engineering Project III. Created by Ash, Amelia, Dan, Fiona & Will.

So as our final project during our time in Makers, we were grouped together with the intention of creating some form of a game, which I believe was everybody's top choice and preference when it came to this project. We spent the first day of our time agreeing on what our approach and working standards would be, and then began to pitch ideas to create a product. There were plenty of features thrown around, such as platforming, map making, turn based battle, text based story/fantasy etc. We somewhat compromised on the platforming part to be map exploring, and quickly put together a game format that would include every other feature. We collectively agreed upon the technology and frameworks we plan to use to develop the game, and there are some new ones in there for quite a few people which should prove both exciting and a great learning experience!

We plan to use Node with Express as our framework, using Cypress for feature tests and Jasmine (and her spies) for unit tests. For the front end we plan to use P5 as our library. We don't plan to create any of the artwork ourselves, and will instead be using free to use opensource materials, so we can focus purely on the code side of things.
